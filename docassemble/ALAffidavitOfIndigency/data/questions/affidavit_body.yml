question: |
  Get help with court costs and fees
subquestion: |
  This short online form will help you fill out an "Affidavit
  of Indigency". This form tells the court that you cannot
  pay court fees.
    
  In some cases the waiver is automatic. In other cases
  we may need to ask you for detailed information about your
  income and expenses.
  
  This form is never filed on its own. Make sure that the court
  know what case to attach this form to. You may want to call
  the court and talk to the clerk before you submit this form. We will
  give you the number of the court clerk at the end of this form.

  You can only use this form to ask the court to help with **new**
  costs. The court cannot give you a refund.
  
  This form and all of your answers on it will be kept confidential
  (private). Only court staff will be able to see your completed form.

template: what_kinds_of_fees_covered_template
subject: |
  What kinds of fees can the court help me with?
content: |
  The court can decide not to charge you costs that you would normally
  pay to the court.
  
  For example:
  
  * Filing fees.
  * Costs for recordings and transcripts of court hearings.
  
  It can also help you pay for certain things that you would pay to
  someone else.
  
  For example:
  
  * The cost of serving a witness or the other party.
  * Cost of taking a deposition.
  * An appeal bond.
  * Cost of an expert witness.
  
  If you ask for something else that is important for your trial,
  the court may be able to pay for it. But it may not.
  
  You cannot use this form to ask the court to pay for an
  attorney to represent you.

  You said this is part of a new case. This form does not start a new
  case on its own. You still need to file that paperwork separately.
  
  Make sure that the cover
  letter with your new case tells the court that you will be filing
  an affidavit of indigency.
  
  If you already filed the new case paperwork without a cover letter,
  call the clerk to explain what you are doing. We will give you the 
  number of your court at the end of this online form.
  % else:
  You said that this is part of an existing case. The clerk needs to 
  know what case you are filing in.
  
  Look for the docket number on any court paperwork you have. It is different
  for each court and each kind of case. It may look a little like this: 
  20-50SU-1234.
  
  If you cannot find the docket number, you may want to call the court clerk

  What amount should I write in?
content: |
  If you are not sure of the exact amount yet, it is OK to leave it blank. You can 
  also write your best guess. For common fees, the court clerk may know the amount and 
  can fill it in for you.

  You may also be able to find the fee by visiting the court's website:
  
  * [List of filing fees in Massachusetts](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/uniform-schedule-of-fees).

  It usually costs about $40 to serve a document on the opposing party, either by using the sheriff or
  a constable.

  If you are asking for something special to your circumstances, researching the exact fee amount
  yourself may help the court decide.
