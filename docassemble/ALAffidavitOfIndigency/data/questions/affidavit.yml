  description: |
    If you cannot pay court fees you can use this online interview to fill out an affidavit of indigency.

    In some cases the fee waiver is automatic and you will be asked fewer questions. In other cases we may need to ask you for detailed information about your income and expenses.
    
    An affidavit of indigency is never filed on its own. Make sure the court knows what case to attach your affidavit to. You may want to call the court and talk to the clerk before you submit your affidavit. We will give you the number of the court clerk at the end of this form.
  can_I_use_this_form: |
    If you are asking for help with **new** costs you can use this form. If you have already paid court fees the court cannot give you a refund.
  before_you_start: |
    The court can decide not to charge you costs that you would normally pay to the court. Examples include:

    * Filing fees
    * Costs for recordings and transcripts of court hearings
    
    It can also help you pay for certain things that you would pay to someone else. For example:

    * The cost of serving a witness or the other party
    * The cost of taking a deposition
    * An appeal bond
    * The cost of an expert witness
    
    If you ask for something else that is important for your trial, the court may be able to pay for it. But it may not.

    You cannot use this form to ask the court to pay for an attorney to represent you.
